Basic Introduction of JAVA:
*JAVA is a platform independent by converting the high level codes into byte code by complilation or interpretation and
that byte code is processed by the JVM( this is platform dependent).
*Everything thing in java works based on Class and Objects.
ex: Java Hello World Program

        public class Main{
            public static void main(String []args){
                System.out.println("Hello World");
            }
        }

*In the above example the public a access modifier which allows us to access the class or methods or variable.
*class- class Keyword.
*Main-Name of the class.
*static-this also a access modifier which denotes the method which can access without creating the objects.
*(String []args)-it denotes the arguments which is passed to the main method.
*System.out.println("Hello World");-System is a class name, out-object, println-method,this all accessed by placing the
 pointer(.),"Hello World"-String data type,(;)-semicolon need to be present at the end of the every declaration.

 Running the Code:
    *To run the code first we need to compile the code which is done by the javac(java compiler) which is in the part of
     the jdk and the code Main.java is compiled then produce the byte code.
    *To run the code by using Java command and the code is run by JVM.
    *Then the file name and the java Main class name must be same.

Why We Need Programming Languages:
    *Basically the CPU(Central Processing Unit) Understand only the machine level language(Binary sequence 0's and 1's)
    humans are not able to understand it or program it due to that the high level languages are developed(C,C++,Java..).
    *That languages codes are in human readable and understandable form then that codes are converted into the low level
    language by compiler and interpreter which converts the high level into low level (binary code) that code can be und
    -erstand by the CPU based on the instruction written in the code the CPU perform the task like control the cache ,
    Main and Storage memory.
    *The Fetching and Retriving the data is done by the OS(operating System) which is act as a mediator between the User
    ,CPU,etc... it also a Software which is execute during the booting of computer.

    COMPILER(Just In Time Compilation(JIT)):                    INTERPRETER:
    *Which convert the source code into the byte code           *it convert the code line by line.
    directly.
    *Fast campared to the interpreter.                          *Slow due to the line by line complilation.
    *All errors are show at once.                               *Line by line errors are showen during the execution.
    *ex:C,C++,JAVA..etc.                                        *ex:Python,JAVA,Ruby..etc.

What is JRE(JAVA Runtime Environment):
    *Which is used to run the code by providing the JVM,Java packages and other component for the execution of code.The
    JRE is under the JDK(JAVA Development Kit).

Static Type Languages:                	                            Dynamic Type Language:
*We need mention what data type we are going to use(JAVA,C,C++).	*Not need to mention the data type the compiler will
                                                                    allocate the memory to the data types(Python..etc).

Variable Naming:
	*The name should be starts with alphabets or underscore.(aaa,Aq,_ww).
	*The name should not be keywords and not contain the special letters.
	*For constant values need to use the full capital letters and with underscore.(MAX_VALUE=10).
    *If a Variable contains more word means the words Starting should be in capital.(NameOfPerson).
